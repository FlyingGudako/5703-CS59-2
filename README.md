Runnable files: There are two files in the code folder. fed.ipynb is the main file, which contains the innovative algorithm of the project and the Fedavg version (used for comparative testing). prox.ipynb is a version using the Fedprox aggregation algorithm, which can be used for comparative testing.
Ensure the data path during runtime. It is recommended that the code file and data file be in the same directory.
