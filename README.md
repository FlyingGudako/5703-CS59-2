his project aims to develop a federated 
learning model to identify high-risk patients for postoperative gastric cancer
recurrence. Gastric cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
deaths worldwide, and early detection of recurrence is crucial for improving
patient outcomes. However, the sensitive nature of medical data often limits
data sharing and comprehensive model training.
Federated learning offers a solution by enabling the training of a robust predictive
model across multiple healthcare institutions without sharing patient data. Each
institution trains the model locally on their data, and only the model updates
are shared and aggregated, preserving patient privacy.
The project involves the following key steps:
1. Model Development: Designing a federated learning framework tailored to
predict postoperative recurrence of gastric cancer, leveraging advanced deep
learning techniques.
2. Training and Validation: Implementing the federated learning model, ensur-
ing effective communication and aggregation of model updates from different
institutions, and validating the model's performance.
The ultimate goal is to create a powerful predictive tool that can be deployed
across various healthcare settings, enabling early intervention and personalized
treatment plans for patients at high risk of gastric cancer recurrence, while
maintaining data privacy and security.
